                    Cold compress
                    <br>
                    A cold compress is a comfort measure that can provide immediate relief. Use one or more small pieces of linen cloth and dip it in ice cold water. Remove the excess water from the cloth and apply it on your eyes. This can help you reduce itchiness and swelling caused due to the foreign substance that has entered the eyes. Repeat this several times for at least 5-10 minutes. It is advised to use different cloth pieces for both the eyes to avoid the infection from increasing.

                    Saline solution
                    <br>
                    Washing your eyes with saline solution is an effective home remedy against allergic conjunctivitis. Saline solution is a mixture of common salt and water. Use saline solution as an eyewash. Saline solution helps minimise inflammation and irritation in the eyes. Make sure you don't use hot saline solution which can cause more harm to your eyes than good.

                Rose water
                <br>
                Rose water has anti-inflammatory and soothing properties. A few drops of rose water a day in the infected eye for 2-3 days can help you treat allergic conjunctivitis. You can also put cotton balls dipped in rose water over your eyes. This will help you with the irritation. Rose water is cool and soothing for the eyes, and helps to get rid of the dust particle that caused allergic conjunctivitis in the first place.
