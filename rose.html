                    1. The Stimulating Breath (Bellows Breath)
                    <br>
                    The stimulating breath or bellows breath is a great way to boost your energy. This type of breathing practice is often done in yoga to help increase Prana, or life force energy.
                    <br>
                    The stimulating breath can help you increase your energy and help you be more alert. The bellows breath is a safe practice, but it could make you dizzy initially until your body gets used to the increased energy.
                    <br> 
                    Strive for no more than 15 seconds or so on your first try, working up to a minute. Each time you practice this breath, you can increase your time little by little.
                    <br>
                    <br>Sit up tall with your back straight and relax your shoulders.
                    <br>Begin inhaling and exhaling rapidly through your nose. Keep your mouth closed but relaxed. The in and out breaths should be equal in duration, but as short and quick as possible. The bellows breath is a noisy breathing exercise.
                    <br>Try for three complete breath cycles per second. As you breathe, you will notice a quick movement of the diaphragm, like a bellows.
                    <br>This technique should leave you feeling invigorated and alert.

                    Relaxing Breathing (4-7-8) Exercise
                    <br>
                    <br>The 4-7-8 breathing exercise is a straightforward technique, as well. It involves breathing in while counting to four, holding the breath to the count of seven, and exhaling to the count of eight.
                    <br>This technique is a natural tranquilizer for the nervous system. However, you should not do more than four breaths at one time initially because it may leave you feeling lightheaded.
                    <br>
                    <br>Sit with a straight back and relax your shoulders.
                    <br>Place your tongue tip against the tissue behind your upper front teeth and try and keep your tongue in place as you breathe.
                    <br>Inhale through your nose to a count of four.
                    <br>Hold your breath for seven seconds.
                    <br>Exhale through your mouth for approximately eight seconds.
                    <br>This is considered one cycle of breath. You may repeat this three or four more times.
                    <br>
                    The most important thing about this exercise is the 4-7-8 ratio. If you have trouble holding your breath for seven seconds, you can speed the practice up.
                    <br>
                    Once you learn this technique, you can use it to combat stress when you feel it coming on.

                    Counting the Breath
                    <br>
                    Counting the breath is another good exercise.
                    <br>
                    <br>Sit in a comfortable position with your back straight. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths in and out breathe naturally.
                    <br>Now, as you inhale, mentally count to one and slowly exhale.
                    <br>Inhale again, counting to two, and slowly exhale.
                    <br>Repeat this cycle as long as you feel like doing it, counting as you go.
                    <br>Strive for a ten-minute breathing practice.

                    Exercises to Help with Anxiety and Stress
                    <br>
                    <br>Researchers at John Hopkins University in Baltimore, MD, reviewed nearly 19,000 meditation 
                    studies. The research showed that mindfulness meditation could help ease psychological stresses like anxiety, 
                    depression, and even pain. (Goyal, 2014).

                    The Body Scan Meditation
                    <br>
                    The body scan meditation, or body awareness, is an exercise that allows you to tune out distractions while focusing on various areas of the body.
                    <br>
                    Body Scanning is a great technique that helps you become more aware of how you are feeling in any given moment.
                    <br>
                    Excess muscle tension exacerbates muscle pain, headaches, and fatigue, and scanning the body can help you prevent the build-up of pressure.
                    <br>
                    You can either do a quick body scan or a more extended scan. A quick scan can help you immediately release tension, and it only takes a few seconds.
                    <br>
                    <br>Get into a comfortable position. You can sit or lie down.
                    <br>Close your eyes for a deeper practice.
                    <br>Starting with your feet and toes, tune into and pay attention to any sensations you feel, like pain or discomfort. You may also notice sensations like tingling, stinging, aching or throbbing.
                    <br>Take a nice deep breath in through your nose, exhaling through the mouth, releasing the uncomfortable sensation. Allow that area of your body to release, loosen up, and soften.
                    <br>Work your way up the body, paying attention to how you feel as you focus on the legs, the hips, the back, the stomach, the chest, the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, and finally the face.
                    <br>Move progressively up your body, focusing on each muscle group one at a time.
                    <br>This body awareness exercise is available as part of the Positive Psychology Toolkit.

                    Diaphragmatic breathing or abdominal breathing is another good way to ease stress and anxiety. Breathing in this manner produces the relaxation response in the body, which allows the respiratory system to function correctly.
                    <br>
                    Breathing shallow can often contribute to feelings of anxiety, panic, or stress. Practicing abdominal breathing allows the mind and body to slow down and relax.
                    <br>
                    <br>Lie on your back on a supportive surface. Bend your knees and support your head with a pillow. You may also place a pillow under your knees.
                    <br>Place one hand on your chest and the other below your rib cage. Breathe in deeply through your nose so you can feel the hand on your stomach gently rising.
                    <br>Allow the muscles of your stomach to tense and tighten as you exhale through your lips.
                    <br>Practice this breathing technique for about 5-10 minutes 3-4 times a day if possible. This type of deep breathing is excellent for stress, and it helps calm and relaxes you.
                    <br>This diaphragmatic breathing exercise is available as part of our Toolkit.

                    Progressive muscle relaxation is a simple exercise where you tense and release all the muscles in your body, working your way up from the feet and toes to the head.
                    <br>
                    The exercise is designed to help the body progressively relax, just like the name sounds. This technique can help decrease muscle tension, fatigue, neck and back pain, or even muscle spasms.
                    <br>
                    This technique also reduces the physiological tension caused by thoughts that tend to provoke anxiety.
                    <br>
                    In this exercise, you should strive to tense and then relax all of those large muscles in the body. This should be done systematically either working your way down from the head or up from the feet and toes.
                    <br>
                    Deep muscle relaxation helps reduce physiological tension as well.
                    <br>
                    <br>Get into a comfortable position, either sitting or lying down.
                    <br>Strive to tense and then release each large muscle or muscle group for about five seconds or so, then relax the muscles.
                    <br>Begin by taking a few deep breaths from the abdomen. Tense, hold, and relax each large muscle group, working your way up or down the body.
                    <br>Try and notice the contrast between a tensed state and a relaxed state inhaling as you tense the muscle and exhaling as you relax and let go.
                    <br>Once you have mastered this technique, you can then do a quick version in which whole muscle groups are tensed and relaxed simultaneously.
                    <br>This relaxation exercise is also available at the BYU Counseling and Psychological Services website.

                    Visualization
                    <br>
                    Visualization is a beautiful way to calm and relax the body, and it can also help you sleep. Anytime you use your imagination, you are in essence, daydreaming and visualizing.
                    <br>
                    Visualization for relaxation and sleep utilizes the imagination to create a mental location where the mind can be calm, and the body can be relaxed.
                    <br>
                    According to Brigham Young University, visualization helps relax the mind and body, clearing away the clutter of the day.
                    <br>
                    As you visualize, you can practice seeing things with all of your senses.
                    <br> 
                    Visualization, also called Guided Imagery is a wonderful way to take a mini-vacation in your mind.
                    <br>
                    <br>Start by closing your eyes and imagining in your mind a peaceful and relaxing place like a beach or a park.
                    <br>Allow your imagination to feel and see everything, using all of your senses. Feel the warm sun, hear the ocean, or watch the birds.
                    <br>If stressful thoughts enter your mind, acknowledge them, and dismiss them.

                    The Blackboard Technique
                    <br>
                    Counting is another good way to help you fall asleep. The blackboard technique involves writing numbers down on a chalkboard and then erasing them in your mind.
                    <br>
                    You can also imagine a black curtain and watch the numbers appear and disappear. The act of having to keep track of numbers makes you sleepy because you will get bored trying to do so.
                    <br>
                    <br>Start by closing your eyes and picturing a huge blackboard. The blackboard can be as big as you are.
                    <br>Now in your imagination, take the chalk and write down the number 100 on the board as large as you can write it.
                    <br>Then erase the number away as slowly as you can, making sure that all of the chalk is removed from the blackboard.
                    <br>Write the number 99 next, then erasing it very slowly.
                    <br>Continue counting down until you fall asleep or reach zero when the task begins again.
                    <br>You may be surprised at how quickly you lose track of the numbers and drift off to sleep.

                    <b>Meditation to Improve Concentration</b>
                    <br>
                    Focused Meditation is a good way to improve your concentration and focus.
                    <br>
                    Focused meditation is a technique where you choose to focus on something like an object with solitary intent. You would focus on this object to the exclusion of all other things.
                    <br>
                    For example, you can focus on a flower, a small stone, or anything you find lying around like a candle or a decorative object. You can also focus on the object with your eyes open, and then close your eyes and try and imagine the object in every little detail.
                    <br>
                    In this exercise, you would practice focusing with attention without trying too hard. By choosing to focus on one thing only, like a small object, you begin to quiet your busy mind and feel that sense of peace in the spaces between the thoughts.
                    <br>
                    The focused meditation technique is a very calming and centering practice because it anchors you in the present moment, freeing you from judgments about the past or worrying about the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>Find an object to focus on. If you would like to hold an object to start with, you may do that now.
                    <br>Begin by closing your eyes and focusing your attention on your breath, breathing slowly and deeply.
                    <br>Now begin to focus on your object. If you are holding something, open your eyes for a brief moment and study the object, looking at all those little details. Gently close your eyes once again.
                    <br>If you are picturing an object, start thinking about the item and focus your attention on what you recall about the object. If you are inside, you can also focus in on whatever is nearby like a lamp, a candle, or a small object.
                    <br>Imagine this object in every little detail. If you are outside, focus on something in your immediate environment.
                    <br>As you close your eyes, try and recall every little detail of this object in your mind’s eye, and see how powerful your perceptions are. Recall all of the tiny little details down to each crease and each small little bump. Focus all of your attention on this process and see what you recall.
                    <br>The more you practice this type of focused meditation, the easier it will be to recall all of those little details, helping you sharpen your focus.

                    Easy Meditation Exercises for Beginners
                    <br>
                    1. Walking Meditation
                    <br>
                    Nothing is simpler than a walking meditation. A walking meditation is a great choice for those who like the outdoors or for those who have trouble sitting still and clearing their mind.
                    <br>
                    In walking meditation, you walk silently and contemplatively. Walking is very calming for the mind, body, and spirit. If you find yourself stressed, one of the best things you can do is to get outside and move and take a break. Taking a short walk, or even a long walk is simple to do, and it can help ease away stress and anxiety.
                    <br>
                    For those who have trouble sitting still, a walking meditation is a wonderful option. Incorporating a simple walking meditation into your day is a wonderful way to ease away the tension of the day. The goal of walking meditation is to become mindful of the present moment. You can do a walking meditation anywhere, but an ideal place is a park or somewhere that has greenery or foliage.
                    <br>
                    This Walking Meditation is based on the guided walking meditation from Jon Kabat-Zinn, a mindfulness expert. (Walking Meditation Greater Good in Action, n.d.).
                    <br>
                    <br>Start by finding a suitable location, a peaceful place where you won’t be disturbed or observed.
                    <br>Walk 10-15 steps and then pause and breathe for as long as you like.
                    <br>Observe the environment around you. Stop and contemplate the trees, the foliage, the flowers, and even the ground you are standing on. Notice all the little details.
                    <br>You can also observe as you walk. The idea behind the practice is to walk silently and with a sense of deep contemplation.
                    <br>You can also focus on the sound of your footsteps as you walk and notice how your feet hit the ground.
                    <br>A walking meditation involves very deliberate thinking and doing a series of actions that you usually do automatically.
                    <br>
                    As you walk, try to focus your attention on one or more sensations that you would typically take for granted, such as your breathing, the way your legs move or how the air feels against your skin.
                    <br>
                    If your mind wanders, continue focusing on something specific in your environment.
                    <br>
                    Our Toolkit also includes a downloadable PDF and MP3 Mindful Walking tool.

                    Gratitude Meditation
                    <br>
                    A Gratitude Meditation is a practice where you reflect on all the gifts in your life. It’s a simple practice with significant results.
                    <br>
                    This meditation offered by Dr. Kathi Kemper at the Ohio State University’s Center for Integrative Health and Wellness is a great place to start.
                    <br>
                    The practice of focusing on things you feel grateful for can help you shift your focus away from the negative and onto the positive.
                    <br>
                    As you experience positive emotions like gratitude, loving-kindness, and compassion, your awareness broadens, and your creativity and problem-solving capacities expand.
                    <br>
                    A short version of this meditation could be done by closing your eyes, taking a deep breath and mentally listing 5-7 things you feel grateful for like a warm home, a soft blanket, a loving spouse, a caring friend or even a good job or financial security.

                    Many, if not all, of the techniques described in this article can be used by people of all ages, including children and seniors.
                    <br>
                    One simple practice that can be done with seniors would be the Mindful Listening Practice.
                    <br>
                    Mindful listening involves closing your eyes and taking the time to be still and to listen to what is going on around you. The stream of sounds that occur in our environment can even be compared to the flow of thoughts in our mind.
                    <br>
                    This kind of simple practice can help improve communication skills and help the listener to be more present throughout the day.

                    Classroom Meditation Activities for Students
                    <br>
                    Concordia University-Portland suggests a few mindfulness meditation activities that can be easily taught to students such as the:
                    <br>
                    <br>1. Stillness Challenge.
                    <br>2. Breathing Buddy Meditation.
                    <br>3. Sound Focus.

                    Stillness Challenge
                    <br>
                    Using a timer and calming music is a great way to teach children the basic premise behind meditation and mindfulness.
                    <br>
                    Students are asked to sit still and listen to the soothing music without moving. You can also dim the lights and perhaps set a timer for 3-5 minutes.
                    <br>
                    Ask students to find a cozy spot and to sit comfortably and tell them that together you are going to start a new stillness challenge.
                    <br>
                    The object of the challenge is to sit with your eyes closed without moving or fidgeting as much as possible.
                    <br>
                    Once the timer goes off, they can then open their eyes and stretch. You can also start with 1 minute and work up to more extended time frames.

                    Breathing Buddy Meditation
                    <br>
                    The breathing buddy meditation involves holding a stuffed animal. Students begin by choosing a stuffed animal like a teddy bear and then lying down and closing their eyes.
                    <br>
                    Next, you set a timer for 3-5 minutes and ask the students to place the stuffed animal on their belly as they rest.
                    <br>
                    If the object falls off, they can put it back and keep breathing. The objective is to keep the focus on the breath and to balance the object for as long as they can do so.

                    Sound Focus Meditation
                    <br>
                    The sound focus meditation involves listening to some bell or tone, like a Tibetan singing bowl.
                    <br>
                    Students are asked to sit comfortably with their eyes closed. As students listen to the bell or the tone, they are asked to breathe quietly and listen intently, especially as the sound fades away.
                    <br>
                    This exercise is a good way to help students learn to focus and concentrate.

                    Quick and Fun Meditation Activities
                    <br>
                    <br>Exercise One – One Minute of Mindfulness
                    <br>One quick and fun mindfulness meditation you can do is the One Minute of Mindfulness exercise.
                    <br>
                    This exercise can also be done throughout the day. Set a timer for 60 seconds and use the minute to focus solely on your breathing. Notice how your breath sounds as you breathe in and out and notice how your body feels. If your mind starts wandering, bring your attention back to your breathing.
                    <br>
                    This may seem like a simple exercise, but it can be a very powerful one. You can do this exercise with your eyes opened or closed.
                    <br>
                     
                    <br>
                    <br>Exercise Two – Conscious Observation
                    <br>This is another quick technique that can help you clear your mind. Pick up an object you have lying around. Any object will do. Hold the object in your hands and allow your attention to be fully absorbed by the object. If you are holding a coffee mug, notice how it feels in your hands. Don’t over-analyze it either, allow yourself to be present in the moment.
                    
                    This type of conscious observation is a powerful form of meditation.
                    
                    Here is a 20-minute Observer Meditation guide.

                    Mindfulness Meditation Exercises
                    <br>
                    There are many mindfulness exercises you can practice. A simple breathing exercise is a good place to start.
                    <br>
                    
                    Two-Minute Breathing Exercise
                    <br>
                    Begin by getting into a comfortable position. Set a timer for 2 minutes. Close your eyes so you won’t be distracted. Relax and see if you notice any areas that seem tight or stiff. If you do, try breathing in and softening those areas.
                    <br>
                    Check-in with your body and notice how your back feels against the chair or how your feet feel touching the floor. Notice the gentle pull of gravity.
                    <br>
                    Breathe in through your nose and exhale through your mouth. Notice how the breath effortlessly flows. Notice your belly rising and falling.
                    <br>
                    Pay attention to how this quick meditation makes you feel as you open your eyes.
