                    Wide-Knee Child’s Pose (Balasana)
                    <br>
                    This resting pose provides a sense of calm and stability. Be cautious if you have hip or knee injuries.
                    <br>
                    <br>Kneel on the floor and bring your big toes together.
                    <br>Separate your knees hips width apart or as wide as the edges of the mat.
                    <br>Exhale and sink your torso onto your thighs.
                    <br>Let your hands relax alongside your torso, so your arms are pointed to the back of the room, palms facing up. This should release shoulder tension by widening your shoulder blades away from each other.
                    <br>If you want a more active pose, reach your hands forward, palms down on the mat.
                    <br>Keep your forehead on the ground. Roll your head to each side gently. This releases tension in your brow.
                    <br>Take slow and steady breaths, in and out through your nose.

                    Stand with your feet hips width apart. Inhale deeply.
                    <br>Exhale and extend your torso forward and over your legs to elongate your spine.
                    <br>Hold onto your elbows or let your hands rest on your shins or the floor.
                    <br>Do not strain to reach the floor—the purpose is not to achieve a perfect shape, but is to elongate the spine and relax your neck and shoulders.

                    <br>This forward bend allows you to relax your neck tension and gently stretches your hamstrings, calves, and hips. Be careful if you have a back injury.
                    <br>If it is difficult for your hands to reach the floor or your back is uncomfortable, place blocks under each hand to provide more support.
                    <br>Breathe in and out through your nose slowly and smoothly.
                    <br>If you have tight hamstrings, keep your knees “soft” by bending them slightly so thatyour chest can relax on your thighs.
                    <br>Gently shake your head “yes” and “no” to relax and loosen your neck muscles.
                    <br>To come up, roll up slowly to standing to avoid getting light-headed.

                    <br>Place your mat perpendicular to the wall.
                    <br>Stand about a foot away from the wall.
                    <br>Your feet should be hips width apart and parallel to the edges of the mat.
                    <br>Press your hands against the wall with your palms spread at the height of your hips.
                    <br>Step back with your feet hips width apart and lower your torso until you come into a flat back position, so that your torso is perpendicular to the floor.
                    <br>Use your palms to press the wall away from you to lengthen your back.
                    <br>Press into all four corners of your feet.
                    <br>Keep your ears in line with your arms.
                    <br>Adjust your distance from the wall to make sure your body is at a 90-degree angle (L shape). If you are too close to the wall, your back and arms will not be able to be fully extended. If you are too far from the wall, you will not be able to bend forward enough.
                    <br>Continue to breathe deeply as you press the wall away from you with your palms.

                    This pose eases tension in your hips and groin area. Be cautious if you have knee, hip or groin injuries.
                    <br>
                    <br>Lie down on the mat.
                    <br>Bend your knees, and place your feet on the floor, close to your tailbone.
                    <br>Bring the soles of your feet together and allow your knees to relax away from each other, while placing blocks or firm cushions underneath your knees on each side to support your hips.
                    <br>If you have tight hips, you can adjust your feet so that they are further away from your tailbone or add more blocks or cushions under your knees for additional height.
                    <br>Relax your arms on the floor about 45 degrees away from your torso, palms facing the ceiling.
                    <br>Do not press down on knees to create additional tension. Gravity is already doing the work.
                    <br>You should feel a gentle stretch in your hips and groin, but it should not be painful.

                    <br>Place a folded towel or blanket on the seat of the chair. Depending on the height of the chair, you may need a few folded blankets under your sacrum as well.
                    <br>Sit close on the mat, with your seat close to the front of the chair.
                    <br>Lie down on one side with knees bent in fetal position. Scoot onto the center of the mat.

                    <br>Keep your arms relaxed at your sides, palms facing up.
