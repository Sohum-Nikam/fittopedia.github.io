                    <br>At the first sign of a cold, Ayurvedic practitioner and author John Douillard suggests sipping hot water every 10 to 15 minutes for three days.

                    <br>Fight the cold from your kitchen. Ayurveda suggests using food as medicine, says Larissa Hall Carlson, Kripalu Schools faculty member and former Dean of the Kripalu School of Ayurveda. She recommends eating light, simple, and warm foods, particularly “clear foods”—clear broths, clear liquids (water and teas), and seasonal veggies that have some translucence once they’re thoroughly cooked, such as leeks, bok choy, and kale. “Avoid heavy, thick, dense, rich foods, which can be challenging to digest when you’re sick,” says Larissa. That includes dairy products, juices, and sugar-laden breads. Also avoid cold, frozen, dry, and raw foods, which are all hard to digest, she says.

                    Try ginger. Numerous controlled studies (cited here) have found that ginger relieves the symptoms of nausea and vomiting. According to Ayurvedic theory, ginger is one of the best remedies for colds, too. Its pungent nature reduces kapha dosha, which is active during colds and produces excess mucus when it’s out of balance, Larissa explains. But a word of caution from Ayurvedic physician Vasant Lad: Don’t combine ginger and anticoagulant medications such as aspirin, because they’re both blood thinners. In his home remedies book, Vasant recommends inhaling ginger-infused steam to reduce sinus and lung congestion. First, boil 1 teaspoon of ginger in 1 pint of water. Once the water cools a bit, you can lean your face toward the pot (just to the point where it’s comfortable), drape a towel over your head, and inhale the steam through your nose for several minutes. Repeat as needed.

                    Try pranayama and stretching to relieve chest constriction. To relieve breathing-related constriction due to coughing, sneezing, and physical inactivity, Larissa suggests a simple practice called Dirgha pranayama, or Three-Part Breath:
                    <br>
                    <br>Sit in a relaxed position with an elongated spine.
                    <br>Fill up the belly with breath, then fill the rib cage, and then allow the breath to fill your upper chest, even your collarbones.
                    <br>Release the breath in the opposite sequence
