                    March with twist
                    <br>
                    Think of this move as slow high knees with an added twist. Stand with feet hip-width apart, shoulders down, arms overhead, and core braced.
                    <br>
                    <br>Bring right elbow to left knee as you twist through your waist, then return to starting position and repeat on the opposite side. Focus on using your core, not quads,
                    <br>to lift knee and squeeze obliques throughout. Continue to alternate sides for 1 minute.

                    Wide second side crunch
                    <br>
                    <br>Stand with feet hip-width apart and hold a dumbbell in each hand. Turn toes outward and lower into a wide squat (sometimes called a wide second squat) 
                    <br>by squeezing glutes, bending knees, and keeping hips in line with torso. Remember: Don’t stick your butt out.
                    <br>
                    <br>Raise arms into goalpost position (elbows bent to 90 degrees), engage your core, and bend to the right, 
                    <br>trying to tap elbow to thigh. Do 10 reps to the right and 10 to the left. Alternate sides for 20 reps.

                    <br>
                    Stand with feet hip-width apart, hold a medicine ball or dumbbell with both hands, and extend arms in front of chest.
                    <br>
                    <br>Keeping arms straight and shoulders pressed down, rotate your upper body to the right and then return to center. 
                    <br>Do 10 reps to the right and 10 to the left. Alternate sides for 10 reps.

                    <br>Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding a medicine ball with both hands at chest height. Lower the ball to the outside of your right 
                    <br>foot, allowing knees to naturally bend and feet to pivot.
                    <br>
                    <br>Bring the ball across your torso and overhead to the left, feeling your core engage. Increasing 
                    <br>your speed will create more of a challenge. Do 10 reps, then switch sides.

                    <br>Stand with feet a few inches wider than hip-width apart. Grab a dumbbell in each hand and put your 
                    <br>arms in goalpost position. Engage your core and bring left elbow to left thigh by bending at your waist and performing a side crunch.
                    <br>
                    <br>Rather than move elbow down, try to keep arms and shoulders in the same place throughout so you’re forced to use your obliques to perform the move. 
                    <br>Do left side only for 1 minute, then right side only for 1 minute. Alternate sides for 1 minute.

                    <br>
                    <br>Start in a low lunge position with left knee bent, right leg straight behind you, and arms extended overhead. 
                    <br>Hinge forward slightly at hips, so chest is over left thigh.
                    <br>
                    <br>Use your core to lift right knee toward chest and allow arms to come in at sides. Replace leg on floor and, 
                    <br>as quickly as possible, drive forward again. Do 20 reps, then switch sides.
                    <br>
                    Make it harder: For more of a challenge, add a twist, pulling right knee in to touch left elbow each time.

                    <br>Rotate upper body to the right, hooking left elbow to outside of right knee. Don’t allow hips to twist to the right — 
                    <br>instead think about bringing left rib cage to right hip bone. Rotate to the other side to complete 1 rep. Do 20 reps.
