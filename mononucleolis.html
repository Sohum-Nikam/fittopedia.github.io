                    Mono usually causes swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, and groin areas. You may also have other common symptoms, like:
                    <br>
                    <br>fever
                    <br>sore throat
                    <br>white patches on the throat

                    Treating symptoms
                    <br>
                    Treatment usually involves treating symptoms like fever or a sore throat. Mono can cause a person to be prone to secondary bacterial infections. In this case, antibiotics can treat a bacterial:
                    <br>
                    <br>sinus infection
                    <br>strep infection
                    <br>tonsil infection

                    Spleen symptoms
                    <br>
                    Along with other symptoms, mono can cause the spleen to get bigger. The spleen is an organ in your abdomen that stores and filters blood. Almost half of people with a mono infection have an enlarged spleen.
                    <br>
                    Enlarged spleen symptoms include:
                    <br>
                    <br>left side abdomen pain
                    <br>back pain
                    <br>feeling full
                    <br>fatigue
                    <br>shortness of breath

                    Boost your immune system
                    <br>
                    Eat healthy whole foods to help your immune system fight the mono virus.
                    <br>
                    Eat more antioxidant-rich and anti-inflammatory foods, like:

                    Over-the-counter (OTC) medications
                    <br>
                    Use OTC pain relievers to help bring down a fever and ease headaches and muscle aches. These medications won’t get rid of the virus, but they can help make you more comfortable:
                    <br>
                    <br>aspirin (but don’t give it to children and teens)
                    <br>acetaminophen (Tylenol)
                    <br>ibuprofen (Advil)
                    <br>Take these medications only as directed. Taking too much can be harmful. You can also take OTC cold and flu medications that contain pain relievers, such as:

                    How long does mononucleolis last?
                    <br>
                    If you contract the mono virus, you may not have any symptoms at all for four to six weeks. Symptoms may last for only a few days to two to six weeks. Here are some common symptoms and their usual duration:
                    <br>
                    <br>A fever and sore throat may last for about two weeks.
                    <br>Muscle aches and fatigue may last for two to four weeks.
                    <br>An enlarged spleen may take up to eight weeks to go back to normal.
                    <br>Mono may make you feel unwell for up to two months. However, it’s considered rare for symptoms to last longer than six weeks.
                    <br>
                    Rare complications of mono, like an injured or ruptured spleen, can take up to three months to heal. You may need other treatment for a ruptured spleen.

                    Preventing mononucleolis
                    <br>
                    You can’t always prevent getting mono. Someone who has the virus and doesn’t yet have symptoms might not know they have it. Lower your risk for contracting mono and other viral illnesses with these tips:
                    <br>
                    <br>Avoid sharing cups and other drink bottles.
                    <br>Avoid sharing eating utensils.
                    <br>Avoid kissing someone who has symptoms of a respiratory infection.
                    <br>Wash your hands several times a day.
                    <br>Avoid touching your face and eyes.
                    <br>Boost your immune system with a healthy diet.
                    <br>Get plenty of sleep every night.

                    How is mononucleolis spread?
                    <br>
                    EBV spreads from person to person through saliva and other bodily fluids. This is why mono is often called the “kissing disease.”
                    <br>
                    If you kiss a person who has the virus — or you share personal items like utensils, glasses, food, or lip balm — you can become infected. You can also catch mono if someone who is sick coughs or sneezes close to you.
                    <br>
                    Teens and young adults are most likely to get sick with mono symptoms.

                    <br>
                    If you’ve caught mono, you typically have symptoms like:
                    <br>
                    <br>fatigue
                    <br>a sore throat
                    <br>fever
                    <br>swollen lymph nodes in your neck
                    <br>headache
                    <br>muscle aches
                    <br>If your symptoms worsen or persist for more than a day or two, make an appointment to see your doctor. They can determine what’s causing your symptoms and advise you on any next steps.
