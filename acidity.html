                    Constipation? Drink ghee, salt, and hot water
                    <br>
                    Consume a drink made with ghee, salt, and hot water. Ghee helps lubricate the inside of the intestines and salt removes bacteria. Ghee contains butyrate acid, a fatty acid with anti-inflammatory effects that may help with digestionTrusted Source.
                    <br>
                    Fittopedia also suggests eating a ripe banana two hours after dinner, followed by a glass of hot milk or hot water.
                    <br>
                    A tablespoon of castor oil — a known stimulant laxative — taken at bedtime may also provide relief.
                    <br>
                    However, those who are pregnant should avoid castor oil. Consult a healthcare provider if you’re considering castor oil for a child under 12 or taking for prolonged use if you’re over 60.

                    Basically anything taken with warm water can help bloating
                    <br>
                    Fittopedia especially recommends fennel seeds with a glass of warm water. But you could also consider ginger with a drop of honey.
                    <br>
                    If you don’t want to prepare a hot drink, chewing on fennel seed after eating can aid the digestion process and reduce gas and bloating.
                    <br>
                    If you’re a tea drinker, reach for mint tea for fennel tea to help with bloat.

                    Acid reflux? Fennel seeds, holy basil, and other spices may do the trick
                    <br>
                    Pop some saunf (fennel seeds), tulsi leaves (holy basil), or a spice like clove in your mouth and chew slowly.

                    Diarrhea? Eat gourds and keep hydrating
                    <br>
                    Bottle gourd (cabalash) is excellent for diarrhea. You can turn it into a soup, a curry made with tomatoes, or a stew, and eat it with rice.
                    <br>
                    “[This specialty produce] has a lot of fiber and water content, and is easy to digest, low in calories, and light on the stomach.
                    <br>
                    It’s important to avoid dehydration when you have diarrhea, so drink a lot of fluids, more than you normally would.
                    <br>
                    Plain water is best, but you can also try buttermilk or fruit juice — especially apple and pomegranate — or ginger tea. Ginger stimulates digestionTrusted Source and is full of antioxidantsTrusted Source that rehydrate the body and replenish lost nutrients.
                    <br>
                    Ginger is a great remedy for healing diarrhea.
                    <br>
                    According to Ayurveda, if someone has diarrhea it’s not good to stop it immediately by giving medicines. Instead, we recommend taking ginger to ensure the toxins, and the diarrhea, leave the body naturally.

                    <br>Home recipe for diarrhea

                    Indigestion? Cooked veggies and soupy dishes may help
                    <br>
                    If your stomach is upset, check to see what you’ve eaten over the last 24 to 48 hours and find a counterbalance.
                    <br>
                    If afflicted with indigestion, we suggest avoiding dairy or big grains (rice), raw vegetables, and anything that makes the stomach work hard to digest it.
                    <br>
                    Have cooked vegetables that are steamed or stir fried, and only add spices that aid in digestion like ginger, cinnamon, black pepper. For meals, soupy and liquid-like dishes help.
                    <br>
                    Juices are useful too. Take equal quantities of onion juice and honey or a glass of buttermilk mixed with a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic paste for relief.
                    <br>
                    If you have acid reflux, heartburn, or inflammation in the digestive tract, garlic and onion may aggravate it further. Be mindful of what foods work best with your specific body and needs.
